# TinyZIP [WIP]

TinyZIP is my remake of the DEFLATE compression algorithm written entirely in C++ 17. It uses Huffman Encoding + LZ77 to achieve impressive amounts of compression. The idea was inspired by the show Silicon Valley and some cool guy on Discord.

#### How to run?

Obviously, don't use in production lol

Coming soon...

### Todos

 - Translate LZ77 that I wrote in Python to C++ and implement
 - Put examples in here, start playing around with other file formats
